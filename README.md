## My Portfolio

I am showcasing my skills as a developer.<br />
Please reach out to me for any questions, recommendations, or if you want to work together.

### Built Using React and Vite

I live and breathe React!<br />
It is my bread and butter. I am open to other frameworks though.<br />
I moved away from CRA to Vite. 
Vite seems more lightweight.

Challenge me to use Angular or Vue!<br />
You will be suprised.
